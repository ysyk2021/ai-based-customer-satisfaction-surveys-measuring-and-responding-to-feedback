Chapter: Types of Natural Language Processing Techniques Used in Customer Satisfaction Surveys
==============================================================================================

Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we will explore the different types of natural language processing (NLP) techniques commonly used in customer satisfaction surveys. NLP enables businesses to extract valuable insights from text-based feedback, measure sentiment, categorize responses, and respond effectively. This chapter provides an overview of various NLP techniques applied in customer satisfaction survey analysis.

Sentiment Analysis
------------------

### Definition

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, focuses on determining the sentiment expressed in textual data. It involves classifying the sentiment of customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Techniques

1. **Lexicon-based Approaches**: These approaches utilize pre-defined lexicons or dictionaries that assign sentiment scores to words. The sentiment score of each word is aggregated to determine the overall sentiment of the text.

2. **Machine Learning-based Approaches**: These approaches involve training machine learning models on labeled data to classify text into sentiment categories. Models may include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or deep learning algorithms like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers.

Topic Modeling
--------------

### Definition

Topic modeling aims to identify underlying topics or themes within a collection of textual data. It helps businesses understand the main subjects discussed by customers and uncover common themes.

### Techniques

1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: LDA is a popular topic modeling technique that identifies topics as probability distributions over words. It assumes that documents are a mixture of multiple latent topics, and each topic consists of a distribution of words.

2. **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**: NMF decomposes a matrix of term-document frequencies into two matrices representing topics and their associated word weights. It discovers topics by iteratively updating these matrices to minimize the reconstruction error.

Text Classification
-------------------

### Definition

Text classification involves categorizing textual data into predefined classes or categories based on their content. It helps businesses organize and prioritize responses, enabling targeted actions and improvements.

### Techniques

1. **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that utilizes Bayes' theorem to determine the probability of a document belonging to a particular class. It assumes independence among features.

2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVM is a machine learning algorithm that creates a hyperplane to separate different classes in a high-dimensional feature space. It maps textual data into this space for classification.

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
------------------------------

### Definition

Named Entity Recognition aims to identify and classify named entities within text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, or product names. NER helps in extracting relevant information from customer feedback.

### Techniques

1. **Rule-based Approaches**: Rule-based approaches use handcrafted rules and patterns to extract named entities. These rules can be designed based on regular expressions or language-specific patterns.

2. **Machine Learning-based Approaches**: Machine learning models, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Bidirectional LSTM-CRF, can be trained on labeled data to recognize and classify named entities.

Conclusion
----------

This chapter provided an overview of various natural language processing (NLP) techniques used in customer satisfaction surveys. Sentiment analysis helps measure sentiment polarity, topic modeling uncovers underlying themes, text classification categorizes responses, and named entity recognition identifies and classifies specific entities. Each technique has its own set of algorithms and approaches, which businesses can leverage to gain valuable insights from text-based customer feedback. By applying these NLP techniques, companies can effectively analyze feedback, understand customer sentiments, and respond proactively to enhance customer satisfaction.
