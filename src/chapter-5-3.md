Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique that involves using algorithms to identify the emotional tone of a piece of text. In customer satisfaction surveys, sentiment analysis can be used to identify positive or negative feedback from customers, allowing businesses to respond appropriately.

Sentiment analysis can be particularly useful for analyzing open-ended responses, as it allows businesses to gain more detailed insights into customer feedback.
